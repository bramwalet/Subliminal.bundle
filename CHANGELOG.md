- core: be more strict about title matching - a matched title doesn't automatically mean season and episode are correct, too
- core: rewrote the hash matching algorithm to not blindly trust hash matches anymore, but instead episodes have to match the series name, season number, episode number and format (BluRay, HDTV...); movie have to at least match the title, format and codec for the hash to be considered

- plugin now isn't in the dev mode by default and has logging to the console off (in certain configurations this resulted in huge syslogs)
