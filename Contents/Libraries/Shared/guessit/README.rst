GuessIt is a python library that extracts as much information as
possible from a video file.

It has a very powerful filename matcher that allows to guess a lot of
metadata from a video using its filename only. This matcher works with
both movies and tv shows episodes.

For example, GuessIt can do the following::

    $ guessit "Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi"
    For: Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi
    GuessIt found: {
        [1.00] "mimetype": "video/x-msvideo",
        [0.80] "episodeNumber": 3,
        [0.80] "videoCodec": "XviD",
        [1.00] "container": "avi",
        [1.00] "format": "HDTV",
        [0.70] "series": "Treme",
        [0.50] "title": "Right Place, Wrong Time",
        [0.80] "releaseGroup": "NoTV",
        [0.80] "season": 1,
        [1.00] "type": "episode"
    }


Install
-------

Installing GuessIt is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

    $ pip install guessit

or, with `easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::

    $ easy_install guessit

But, you really `shouldn't do that <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install>`_.

You can now launch a demo::

    $ guessit -d

and guess your own filename::

    $ guessit "Breaking.Bad.S05E08.720p.MP4.BDRip.[KoTuWa].mkv"
    For: Breaking.Bad.S05E08.720p.MP4.BDRip.[KoTuWa].mkv
    GuessIt found: {
        [1.00] "mimetype": "video/x-matroska",
        [1.00] "episodeNumber": 8,
        [0.30] "container": "mkv",
        [1.00] "format": "BluRay",
        [0.70] "series": "Breaking Bad",
        [1.00] "releaseGroup": "KoTuWa",
        [1.00] "screenSize": "720p",
        [1.00] "season": 5,
        [1.00] "type": "episode"
    }



Filename matcher
----------------

The filename matcher is based on pattern matching and is able to recognize many properties from the filename,
like ``title``, ``year``, ``series``, ``episodeNumber``, ``seasonNumber``,
``videoCodec``, ``screenSize``, ``language``. Guessed values are cleaned up and given in a readable format
which may not match exactly the raw filename.

The full list of available properties can be seen in the
`main documentation <http://guessit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/properties.html>`_.


Other features
--------------

GuessIt also allows you to compute a whole lot of hashes from a file,
namely all the ones you can find in the hashlib python module (md5,
sha1, ...), but also the Media Player Classic hash that is used (amongst
others) by OpenSubtitles and SMPlayer, as well as the ed2k hash.

If you have the 'guess-language' python package installed, GuessIt can also
analyze a subtitle file's contents and detect which language it is written in.

If you have the 'enzyme' python package installed, GuessIt can also detect the
properties from the actual video file metadata.


Usage
-----

guessit can be use from command line::

    $ guessit
    usage: guessit [-h] [-t TYPE] [-n] [-c] [-X DISABLED_TRANSFORMERS] [-v]
                   [-P SHOW_PROPERTY] [-u] [-a] [-y] [-f INPUT_FILE] [-d] [-p]
                   [-V] [-s] [--version] [-b] [-i INFO] [-S EXPECTED_SERIES]
                   [-T EXPECTED_TITLE] [-Y] [-D] [-L ALLOWED_LANGUAGES] [-E]
                   [-C ALLOWED_COUNTRIES] [-G EXPECTED_GROUP]
                   [filename [filename ...]]

    positional arguments:
      filename              Filename or release name to guess

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    Naming:
      -t TYPE, --type TYPE  The suggested file type: movie, episode. If undefined,
                            type will be guessed.
      -n, --name-only       Parse files as name only. Disable folder parsing,
                            extension parsing, and file content analysis.
      -c, --split-camel     Split camel case part of filename.
      -X DISABLED_TRANSFORMERS, --disabled-transformer DISABLED_TRANSFORMERS
                            Transformer to disable (can be used multiple time)
      -S EXPECTED_SERIES, --expected-series EXPECTED_SERIES
                            Expected series to parse (can be used multiple times)
      -T EXPECTED_TITLE, --expected-title EXPECTED_TITLE
                            Expected title (can be used multiple times)
      -Y, --date-year-first
                            If short date is found, consider the first digits as
                            the year.
      -D, --date-day-first  If short date is found, consider the second digits as
                            the day.
